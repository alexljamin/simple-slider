# simple-slider
This is a simplified full-page width slider. It is simplified for those who start their journey in web development.
There is a unminified version of ``js`` included, so it is easier to make changes and navigate. The unmification was made with [Unminify.com](http://unminify.com/). It uses jQuery and Bootstrap.

I will be updating the following code to make it easier to edit.

I've made only simplification of this slider, so please don't consider this slider fully as my work. All the kudos and the original slider can be found on [Jssor GitHub page](https://github.com/jssor/slider).
